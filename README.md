- Retrieve real-time weather information for any city using an OpenWeatherMap API
- Display the temperature, weather condition, and an appropriate emoji representing the weather
- Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature units through the settings menu
- Simple and clean graphical user interface (GUI) built with PyQt5

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language
- **PyQt5**: For building the GUI
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API
- **OpenWeatherMap**: Big thank you to OpenWeatherMap for providing free APIs that can be used to access real time weather data
